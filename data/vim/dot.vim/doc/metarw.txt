==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION					*metarw-introduction*

*metarw* is a Vim plugin to provide a framework to read/write a file-like
argument of which name is written in URI-like notation such as
"git:master:src/ui.c".  metarw also provides content browser like |netrw|'s
one for some sorts of argumetns if they are given to :edit or other command.


Requirements:
- Vim 7.1.299 or later

Optionals:
- |metarw-scheme-script| such as |metarw-git| (vimscript#2336)
- |ku| (vimscript#2337) and |ku-metarw| (vimscript#2344)

Demo:

INTERFACE					*metarw-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMANDS					*metarw-commands*

:Edit[!] [++opt] [+cmd] [{file}]		*:Edit*
:Read [++opt] [{file}]				*:Read*
:Source [{file}]				*:Source*
:[range]Write[!] [{file}]			*:Write*
			Same as |:edit| and other commands, but the completion
			of their arguments is extended to also complete
			fakepathes.

			These wrapper commands are not defined automatically.
			If you want them, you have to call
			|metarw#define_wrapper_commands()|.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUNCTIONS					*metarw-functions*

						*metarw#complete()*
metarw#complete({arglead}, {cmdline}, {cursorpos})
			Function for |:command-complete| to complete also
			fakepathes.  Use as follows:
			"-complete=customlist,metarw#complete".

					    *metarw#define_wrapper_commands()*
metarw#define_wrapper_commands({override-p})
			Define wrapper commands (see |metarw-commands|.)
			Override existent commands if {override-p} is true.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEY MAPPINGS					*metarw-key-mappings*

The following key mappings are available for |metarw-content-browser|.  All of
them are buffer-local and defined in Normal mode:


<Plug>(metarw-open-here)			*<Plug>(metarw-open-here)*
<Plug>(metarw-open-split)			*<Plug>(metarw-open-split)*
<Plug>(metarw-open-vsplit)			*<Plug>(metarw-open-vsplit)*
			Open the item under the cursor in the current window
			or newly created window.  If there is no item under
			the cursor, nothing will be happened.

<Plug>(metarw-go-to-parent)			*<Plug>(metarw-go-to-parent)*
			Open the "parent" item in the current window.  The
			"parent" item is always the first item listed in
			a content browser.

					    *g:metarw_no_default_key_mappings*
The following key mappings will be also available unless
g:metarw_no_default_key_mappings is defined:

{lhs}			{rhs}
--------		-----------------------------
<Return>		<Plug>(metarw-open-here)
<C-m>			<Plug>(metarw-open-here)
o			<Plug>(metarw-open-split)
v			<Plug>(metarw-open-vsplit)
-			<Plug>(metarw-go-to-parent)


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONTENT BROWSER					*metarw-content-browser*

If some sorts of fakepaths (which depend on their schemes) are given to
|:edit|, |:new| or other commands, metarw will set up the newly created buffer
as a content browser like |newrw|'s one for the given fakepath.

In this content browser, |metarw-key-mappings| are available, and 'filetype'
of a content browser is set to "metarw".  Use this information for your own
customization.




==============================================================================
SCHEMES						*metarw-schemes*

To add your own scheme, write a Vim script and put it under a directory named
"autoload/metarw/" in 'runtimepath'.  Such script is called as a scheme
script.  The name of a scheme script must be "{scheme}.vim", where {scheme} is
the name of the scheme.

Scheme scripts must implements the following functions.  Most of works such as
hooking read/write events are automatically treated by metarw, so you don't
have to think about troublesome stuffs.

						*metarw#{scheme}#complete()*
metarw#{scheme}#complete({arglead}, {cmdline}, {cursorpos})
			Complete the names of fakepaths.  This function is
			like the one which is described at
			|:command-completion-customlist|, but there are the
			following differences:

			- {arglead} is split into "head" part and "tail" part.
			  They must fulfill the following equation:
				{arglead} ==# head_part . tail_part
			- This function must complete candidates which are
			  conteind in a stuff represented by the "head" part.
			- Return value is a list with 3 items.
			  The first item is a list of candidates.
			  The second item is the "head" part.
			  The third item is the "tail" part.
			- Returned candidates will be filtered by callers.  So
			  don't filter in this function.

			For example, when completing file names and {arglead}
			is "foo/b":
			- The "head" part is "foo/".
			- The "tail" part is "b".
			- This function must complete files in the directory
			  "foo/".

metarw#{scheme}#read({fakepath})		*metarw#{scheme}#read()*
			Read the content of {fakepath}.

			This function must return a list with two items.  The
			first item indicates the type of a return value, and
			the second item is an additional information for the
			return value.  The meanings of return values are as
			follows:

			First item	Second item ~
			----------	---------------------------------- ~
						*metarw#{scheme}#read()-error*
			"error"		A string which represents an error
					message.
						*metarw#{scheme}#read()-read*
			"read"		A string which will be given to
					|:read| to read the content of
					{fakepath}.
					       *metarw#{scheme}#read()-browse*
			"browse"	A list to set up
					|metarw-content-browser|.

			If the second item of return value is a list, each
			item in the list is a dictionary which represents an
			item in {fakepath}.  The meaning of key-value pairs
			are:

			"label" (string) /required/
				Displayed as the label of the item.

			"fakepath" (string) /required/
				Used to open an item by
				|<Plug>(metarw-open-here)| or other ways.

			And, the first item should be the "parent" of
			{fakepath}.  This item is used for
			|<Plug>(metarw-go-to-parent)|.

			See also |metarw-content-browser|.

						*metarw#{scheme}#write()*
metarw#{scheme}#write({fakepath}, {line1}, {line2}, {append-p})
			Write or append the content of the current buffer from
			{line1} to {line2} into {fakepath}.  If {append-p} is
			true, does appending instead of writing.

			This function must return a list with one or more
			items like |metarw#{scheme}#read()|, but the meanings
			of return values are as follows:

			First item	Rest items ~
			----------	----------------------------------- ~
					       *metarw#{scheme}#write()-error*
			"error"		The second item must be a string which
					represents an error message.
					       *metarw#{scheme}#write()-write*
			"write"		The second item must be a string which
					will be given to |:write| to write the
					content of {fakepath}.

					The third item is optional; if it is
					given, it must be a string which is
					a Vim script and it will be
					|:execute|d after writing.
						*metarw#{scheme}#write()-done*
			"done"		The rest items are just ignored.  This
					type means that writing is already
					done by |metarw#{scheme}#write()|.

			Don't reset 'modified' in this function.  It will be
			automatically treated by metarw.




==============================================================================
TERMS						*metarw-terms*

Fakepath					*metarw-fakepath*
	Fakepathes are file-like arguments written in URI-like notation.
	For example, "git:master:src/ui.c" is a fakepath.

Scheme						*metarw-scheme*
	Scheme is the substring before the first ":" in the name of
	a fakepath.  For example, the scheme of "git:master:src/ui.c" is
	"git".

	The name of a scheme must consist of 2 or more characters, and it
	should consist of only lowercase, English alphabets.

Scheme script					*metarw-scheme-script*
	Support script to enable to read/write fakepathes.  One scheme script
	supports just one scheme.




==============================================================================
BUGS						*metarw-bugs*

- {range} for ":read {fakepath}" is ignored and it will always be treated as
  the current line.  Because there is no way to get {range} in |FileReadCmd|.

- There are many bugs around the world.




==============================================================================

	    |metarw#{scheme}#write()-write| for the details.

0.0.3	2008-08-30T03:11:55+09:00		*metarw-changelog-0.0.3*
	- |metarw#{scheme}#write()|:
	  - Fix wrong implementation.
	  - Add new type of return value "done".

0.0.2	2008-08-10T23:43:48+09:00		*metarw-changelog-0.0.2*
	- Separate |ku-metarw| as a independent package.
