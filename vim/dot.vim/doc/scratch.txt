==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION					*scratch-introduction*

*scratch* is a Vim plugin to provide Emacs-like scratch buffer.  You can write
anything in it, and you can also evaluate a part of the buffer as Vim script.
It is a temporary buffer and it is not related to a real file, so the content
of the buffer will be discarded when you quit Vim.  This buffer is useful when
you test a bit of script or other use.


Requirements:
- Vim 7.0 or later

==============================================================================
INTERFACE					*scratch-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMANDS					*scratch-commands*

:ScratchOpen					*:ScratchOpen*
	``Open'' the scratch buffer, i.e., create the buffer if it does not
	exist, show if it is not visible, or move the cursor to the window
	that shows it.

	See |g:scratch_show_command| if you want to change the way to open.

:ScratchClose					*:ScratchClose*
	Close a window that shows the scratch buffer if able.

:[range]ScratchEvaluate[!]			*:ScratchEvaluate*
	Evaluate the [range] as a Vim script.
	The default [range] is the current line.
	Without [!], the cursor will be moved to the next line of the script
	after evaluating.  If there is no line to move, new blank line will be
	appended then the cursor will be moved to the new line.
	With [!], such adjustment will not be done.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUNCTIONS					*scratch-functions*

scratch#open()					*scratch#open()*
	Function version of |:ScratchOpen|.
	The return value is not defined.

scratch#close()					*scratch#close()*
	Function version of |:ScratchClose|.
	The return value is not defined.

						*scratch#evaluate_linewise()*
scratch#evaluate_linewise({line1}, {line2}, {adjust-cursorp})
	Function version of |:ScratchEvaluate|.
	If {adjust-cursorp} is true, the cursor position will be adjusted as
	same as |:ScratchEvaluate|.  If {adjust-cursorp} is false, such
	adjustment will not be done.
	The return value is not defined.

scratch#evaluate({pos1}, {pos2}, {adjust-cursorp})	*scratch#evaluate()*
	Same as |scratch#evaluate_linewise()|, but this takes the range of the
	script to be evaluated as {pos1} and {pos2}, which are same as the
	returning value of |getpos()|.
	The return value is not defined.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEY MAPPINGS					*scratch-key-mappings*

GLOBAL MAPPINGS ~

<Plug>(scratch-open)				*<Plug>(scratch-open)*
	Do |:ScratchOpen|.

<Plug>(scratch-close)				*<Plug>(scratch-close)*
	Do |:ScratchClose|.

<Plug>(scratch-evaluate)			*<Plug>(scratch-evaluate)*
	Do |:ScratchEvaluate| without [!].

<Plug>(scratch-evaluate!)			*<Plug>(scratch-evaluate!)*
	Do |:ScratchEvaluate| with [!].

SCRATCH BUFFER-LOCAL MAPPINGS ~

<C-j>	or					*<C-j>*
<C-m>	or					*<C-m>*
<CR>						*<CR>*
	Mapped to |<Plug>scratch-evaluate|.
	Note that these mappings will not be defined when {lhs} is already
	mapped to something.




==============================================================================
CUSTOMIZING					*scratch-customizing*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VARIABLES					*scratch-variables*

						*g:scratch_buffer_name*
g:scratch_buffer_name		string (default: "*Scratch*")
	The name of the scratch buffer.
	Note that this value must be set before this plugin is loaded (for
	example, in $MYVIMRC).

						*g:scratch_show_command*
g:scratch_show_command		string (default: 'topleft split | hide buffer')
	The command to show the scratch buffer.  When this plugin shows the
	scratch buffer, it will execute the following script: >

	execute g:scratch_show_command the_buffer_number_of_the_scratch_buffer
<
	Examples:
	'topleft split | hide buffer' (default value)
		Create new window at the top and show in it.
	'hide buffer'
		Show in the active window.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AUTOCOMMANDS					*scratch-autocommands*

When the scratch buffer is created, two events will be triggered to initialize
it.  If you want to add and/or override the default settings, use |autocmd|
like the following: >

	autocmd User PluginScratchInitializeBefore {any-command}
	autocmd User PluginScratchInitializeAfter {any-command}
<
"User PluginScratchInitializeBefore" is triggered before the default
initialization.  "User PluginScratchInitializeAfter" is triggered after the
default initialization.

The default initialization does:
- set 'filetype' as vim.  (if 'filetype' is not set)
- put some informative message.  (if 'filetype' is vim)
- define several buffer-local key mappings.




==============================================================================
BUGS						*scratch-bugs*

- Don't do |:edit|, |:bunload| or |:bdelete| on the scratch buffer.  The
  content of the scratch buffer and/or other information (e.g., mappings) will
  be cleared.
  If you did it accidentally, do |:bwipeout| then |:ScratchOpen| to recreate
  the scratch buffer.

- |:ScratchOpen| - To create the scratch buffer, the current buffer will be
  hidden temporary.  This behavior may cause some problems.

- |:ScratchEvaluate| - Is it useful to evaluate any programming language other
  than Vim script?




==============================================================================

	- Rewrote.

0.0	2007-xx-xx				*scratch-changelog-0.0*
