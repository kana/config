==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION					*smartword-introduction*

*smartword* is a Vim plugin to provide {motion}s on |word|s which are smarter
than the built-in ones in some sense.  For example, |w| moves the cursor to
the next word as follows (here "|" means a cursor position whenever |w| is
executed):

	<a href="http://www.vim.org/">www.vim.org</a>
	 | |   | |   |  |  ||  ||  |  |  ||  ||  | |

Because there are two types of words and |w| moves to the next word which can
be the both types.  Let's call "L" for a type of words and "P" for another
type of words, where "L" means a word which consists of a sequence of letters
(which can be changed with the 'iskeyword' option) and "P" means a word which
consists of a sequence of other non-blank characters.

In many cases, you might want to move to the next "L", not "P".  This plugin
provides {motion}s to behave so.  For example, |<Plug>(smartword-w)| moves the
cursor as follows:

	<a href="http://www.vim.org/">www.vim.org</a>
	 | |     |      |   |   |     |   |   |    |

See also |smartword-examples| for customization.

- Vim 7.2 or later

INTERFACE					*smartword-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAPPINGS					*smartword-mappings*

<Plug>(smartword-w)				*<Plug>(smartword-w)*
<Plug>(smartword-b)				*<Plug>(smartword-b)*
<Plug>(smartword-e)				*<Plug>(smartword-e)*
<Plug>(smartword-ge)				*<Plug>(smartword-ge)*
			Smart versions of |w|, |b|, |e| and |ge|.
			These mappings are defined in Normal mode, Visual mode
			and Operator-pending mode.




==============================================================================
EXAMPLES					*smartword-examples*

(A) Replace |w| and others with |smartword-mappings|:
>
	map w  <Plug>(smartword-w)
	map b  <Plug>(smartword-b)
	map e  <Plug>(smartword-e)
	map ge  <Plug>(smartword-ge)
<

(B) Use other key sequences for smart version:
>
	map ,w  <Plug>(smartword-w)
	map ,b  <Plug>(smartword-b)
	map ,e  <Plug>(smartword-e)
	map ,ge  <Plug>(smartword-ge)
<

(C) Keep the default meanings of |w| and others in other key sequences:
>
	noremap ,w  w
	noremap ,b  b
	noremap ,e  e
	noremap ,ge  ge
<
