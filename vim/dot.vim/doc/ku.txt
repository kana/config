==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION						*ku-introduction*

Ku is a Vim plugin to support to do something on buffer, files, directories or
other kind of items with automatic completion and fuzzy pattern.  You can also
define your own kind of items.

To start selection, use |ku-commands|.  The commands will open a new window
(|ku-window|) to take user input.  As user inputs some characters, pop-up menu
(|ins-completion-menu|) will be automatically appeared and updated to show the
proper candidates for the input pattern.

							*ku-window* *ku-buffer*
ku window		The window which is opened by |ku-commands|.
			This window will be automatically closed when:
			- An action is taken for an item.
			- Selecting is canceled.
			- Another window or another tab page is acticated.




==============================================================================
COMMANDS						*ku-commands*

:Ku[!] [{preferred-type}]				*:Ku*
			Start selecting by ku.
			[bang] modifier will be used by an action.
			{preferred-type} specifies what type of items to be
			appeared in the completion list.  If it is omitted,
			all type of items will be appeared.




==============================================================================
FUNCTIONS						*ku-functions*

ku#start({bang}, [{preferred-type}])			*ku#start()*
			Function version of |:Ku|.

ku#default_key_mappings()			   *ku#default_key_mappings()*
			Define the following key mappings for the ku window
			to the current buffer.

			Modes	{lhs}		{rhs} ~
			ni	<C-c>		<Plug>(ku-cancel)
			ni	<Return>	<Plug>(ku-do-default)
			ni	<Tab>		<Plug>(ku-choose-action)
			ni	<C-j>		<Plug>(ku-next-type)
			ni	<C-k>		<Plug>(ku-previous-type)

ku#bang()						*ku#bang()*
			Return whether [bang] modifier is given for the last
			executed |:Ku| or |ku#start()|.  String "!" will be
			returned if [bang] modifier is given, otherwise an
			empty string will be returned.

ku#register_type({typedef})				*ku#register_type()*
			Register new type which is defined by {typedef}.
			{typedef} is a dictionary.  See |ku-write-new-type|
			for the detail of {typedef}.

			Note that any built-in type can be overridden.

ku#unregister_type({name})				*ku#unregister_type()*
			Unregister the type {name}.

			Note that any built-in type can be unregistered.

ku#custom_action({type-name}, {action-name}, {funcref})	*ku#custom_action()*
			Define {funref} as a new action named {action-name}
			for items of the type {type-name}.

ku#custom_key({type-name}, {key}, {new-action-name})	*ku#custom_key()*
			Define {key} to do the action {new-action-name} for
			items of the type {type-name} in
			|<Plug>(ku-choose-action)|.




==============================================================================
KEY MAPPINGS						*ku-key-mappings*

In the ku window, the following key mappings are defined:

<Plug>(ku-cancel)					*<Plug>(ku-cancel)*
			Cancel selecting (and close the ku window).

<Plug>(ku-do-default)				       *<Plug>(ku-do-default)*
			Do the default action for the current item.

<Plug>(ku-choose-action)			    *<Plug>(ku-choose-action)*
			Show the mesasge on available actions, take a single
			key input, then do the appropriate action.

<Plug>(ku-next-type)					*<Plug>(ku-next-type)*
<Plug>(ku-previous-type)			    *<Plug>(ku-previous-type)*
			Change the preferred type (ascending / descending).

The default key mappings are defined by |ku#default_key_mappings()|.




==============================================================================
TYPES							*ku-types*

Types are kinds of items.  The following types are built-in.

Type Name	Remarks ~
buffer		Only 'buflisted' buffers can be selected.
file		...




==============================================================================
CUSTOMIZING						*ku-customizing*

Initialization						*ku-initialization*
							*KuBufferInitialize*
	Ku has its own buffer to do its work.  Whenever the buffer is created,
	"User KuBufferInitialize" event will be published.  Use this event to
	do user's initialization for the buffer, for example: >

		autocmd User KuBufferInitialize  call MyOwnInitialization()
<
	If there is no autocommand for |KuBufferInitialize|, Ku will call
	|ku#default_key_mappings()|.

Write New Type						*ku-write-new-type*
	To use new type, call |ku#register_type()| with its {typedef}.
	{typedef} is a dictionary and it contains the following entries:

	'name'		string
		The name of this type.  It consits of only lowercase
		alphabets.

	'gather'	funcref
		The function to gather items matching to the given pattern.
		It is called with one parameter, the user input pattern.
		It must return the list of |complete-items|.

	'initialize'	funcref		(optional)
		The function which will be called with no argument whenever
		the ku window is opened.  The main purpose of this function is
		to do some initialization for 'gather'.

	'keys'		dictionary
		The table which contains what action is associated with a key.
		This information is used by |<Plug>(ku-choose-action)|.

		Each key of an entry is a string representation of a key to
		press.  The string "*default*" is used by
		|<Plug>(ku-do-default)|.

		Each value of an entry is a string of the name of an action.

	'actions'	dictionary
		The table which contains the available actions for items of
		this type and their names.

		Each key is a string of the name of an action.

		Each value is a funcref to the function which is called with
		one parameter, the selected item (as described in
		|complete-items|).
