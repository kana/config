INTRODUCTION					*smartchr-introduction*

*smartchr* is a Vim plugin to support input several candidates with a single
key, like ess-smart-underscore in Emacs Speaks Statistics -- when user types
"_" key, it inserts " <- " for the first time or it replaces " <- " by "_" for
the second time.  This plugin provides a function to support to define such
key bindings.


Requirements:
- Vim 7.1 or later

INTERFACE					*smartchr-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUNCTIONS					*smartchr-functions*

						*smartchr#loop()*
smartchr#loop(...)
	Same as |smartchr#one_of()|, but it returns the key sequence to
	replace the {N}th argument by the 1st argument for the {N+1}th time.
	For example,
>
		inoremap <expr> _  smartchr#loop(' <- ', '_')
<
	With the above setting, whenever user types "_" key:
	- " <- " is inserted for the 1st time, or
	- the previously inserted " <- " is removed then "_" is inserted for
	  the 2nd time, or
	- the previously inserted "_" is removed then " <- " is inserted for
	  the 3rd time, and so forth.

						*smartchr#one_of()*
smartchr#one_of(...)
	Returns a string which represents the key sequence to insert one of
	the given arguments.  For example, the following setting emulates
	ess-smart-underscore in Emacs Speaks Statistics:
>
		inoremap <expr> _  smartchr#one_of(' <- ', '_')
<
	With the above setting, whenever user types "_" key:
	- " <- " is inserted for the 1st time, or
	- the previously inserted " <- " is removed then "_" is inserted for
	  the 2nd time.

	More generally, this function returns the key sequence to:
	- insert the 1st argument for the 1st time, or
	- replace the 1st argument by the 2nd argument for the 2nd time, or
	- ...
	- replace the {N-1}th argument by the {N}th argument for the {N}th
	  time.
