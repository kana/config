INTRODUCTION					*metarw-git-introduction*

metarw-git is a scheme for |metarw| to read or to browse various objects in
a git repository with fakepaths like "git:HEAD~3:src/ui.c".

Note that this scheme just supports reading from an object.  Writing to an
object is not supported.

Requirements:
- Vim 7.1.299 or later.
- metarw 0.0.0 or later.

==============================================================================
NOTATIONS					*metarw-git-notations*

In metarw-git, the following notations are available.

						*git:{commit-ish}:{path}*
git:{commit-ish}:{path}
	Show the result of "git show {commit-ish}:{path}", where:
	- {commit-ish} is a commit object or a tag object pointing to a commit
	  object.  Example: master, HEAD, HEAD^3, v0.0.0
	- {path} is the path to a blog or a tree object in the {commit-ish}.

git:{commit-ish}:{tree}/	OR		*git:{commit-ish}:{tree}/*
git:{commit-ish}:		OR		*git:{commit-ish}:*
git:						*git:*
	Show the content by |metarw-content-browser| if it is suitable.
	Otherwise, same as "git:{commit-ish}:{path}".

	The 1st form shows the content of the {tree} in {commit-ish}.
	The 2nd form shows the content of the top tree in {commit-ish}.
	The 3rd form shows the all branches of the current repository.

				       *git:@{git-dir}* *git:@{git-dir}:[...]*
Additionally, GIT_DIR can be specified with the following notation:

	git:@{git-dir}:[...]

The rest part ([...]) is same as the notations already described and it can be
ommitted.  If {git-dir} part is ommitted, it is treated as "./.git".




==============================================================================
BUGS						*metarw-git-bugs*

- Whenever you do |:cd|, the content of buffers opened via metarw-git without
  {git-dir} may be changed if they are reloaded.

- metarw-git should complete {git-dir} in |metarw-git-notations| but it
  doesn't support yet.

- There are many bugs around the world.




==============================================================================
