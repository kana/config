==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION					*xml_autons-introduction*

*xml_autons* is an additional Vim filetype plugin for XML to execute |:XMLns|
according to the content of the current buffer.  This supports to use omni
completion for XML (|ft-xml-omni|), because it requires to execute |:XMLns|.


Requirements:
- Vim 7.0 or later




==============================================================================
INTERFACE					*xml_autons-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMANDS					*xml_autons-commands*

:AutoXMLns						*:AutoXMLns*
			Do |:XMLns| according to the content of the current
			buffer.  For example, if the current buffer has the
			following content: >

			<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
			<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
			  xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
			  xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
			  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
			  exclude-result-prefixes="xsl h">
			  <!-- many templates ... -->
			</xsl:stylesheet>
<
			:AutoXMLns will execute the following commands: >

			:XMLns xsl xsl
			:XMLns xhtml11 h
			:XMLns xhtml11
<
			:AutoXMLns will be automatically executed for each
			time you begin to edit an XML document, so that you
			don't have to do it manually.

			See also |g:AutoXMLns_Dict|.




==============================================================================
CUSTOMIZING					*xml_autons-customizing*

g:AutoXMLns_Dict					*g:AutoXMLns_Dict*
			|Dictionary| to translate a namespace URI to the
			corresponding name for |:XMLns|.  For example, If you
			prefer XHTML 1.0 Strict to XHTML 1.1, set as follows:
>
			let g:AutoXMLns_Dict['http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml']
			    \ = 'xhtml10s'
<
			As the default, XHTML 1.1 and XSLT are supported.




==============================================================================
BUGS						*xml_autons-bugs*

- |:AutoXMLns| checks only namespace declarations in the root tag.  So that
  declarations in other tags are ignored.  Because namespaces may be locally
  overriden and |ft-xml-omni| cannot deal with such XML documents correctly.

- |:AutoXMLns| checks only namespace URIs and doesn't check DTD decralations.
  This may cause some accidents, for example, the namespace URI of XHTML 1.1
  and the one of XHTML 1.0 Strict (and other variants) are same.  So that
  :AutoXMLns may treat the current buffer as XHTML 1.1 even if the proper
  version is XHTML 1.0 Strict.

- |:AutoXMLns| uses |:XMLns|, so that this filetype plugin must be placed
  |after-directory| to load it after the default filetype plugin.

- When new |xml-omni-datafile| is added, you have to add the entry for it to
  |g:AutoXMLns_Dict| manually.  It is convenient to compute the default values
  of |g:AutoXMLns_Dict| from |xml-omni-datafile| in 'runtimepath', but
  |xml-omni-datafile| doesn't contain the corresponding namespace URI.




==============================================================================
