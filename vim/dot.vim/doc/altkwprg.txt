==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION					*altkwprg-introduction*

*altkwprg* is a Vim plugin to provide 'keywordprg'-like features with
|:help|-like window.

Requirements:
- Vim 7.2 or later




==============================================================================
INTERFACE					*altkwprg-interface*

<Plug>(altkwprg-look)				*<Plug>(altkwprg-look)*
			Like |K|, but:

			- Open a new window like |:help|.  If such window is
			  already opened, use the window.

			- Create a new buffer for the keyword.  If such buffer
			  already exists, switch to the buffer.

			- Show output same as |K| in the buffer.

{Visual}<Plug>(altkwprg-look)			*v_<Plug>(altkwprg-look)*
			Like |<Plug>(altkwprg-look)|, but look up the selected
			text.

					  *g:altkwprg_no_default_key_mappings*
						*:AltkwprgDefaultKeyMappings*
This plugin automatically defines the following key mapping unless key
mappings with same {lhs}s are already defined.  If you don't want these key
mappings, define |g:altkwprg_no_default_key_mappings| before this plugin is
loaded (e.g. in $MYVIMRC).  You can also use |:AltkwprgDefaultKeyMappings| to
redefine these key mappings.

	modes	{lhs}	{rhs}			~
	-----	-----	---------------------	~
	nv	K	<Plug>(altkwprg-look)


g:keywordprg					*g:keywordprg*
b:keywordprg					*b:keywordprg*
	Alternative variables to 'keywordprg'.  These variables have higher
	priorities than 'keywordprg', and |b:keywordprg| has higher priority
	than |g:keywordprg|.

	Values of these variables are used like 'keywordprg', but they may
	contain the following escape sequence:

	<keyword>	Expanded to the keyword to look up.

	<count>		Expanded to the given count or empty if count is not
			given.

	|b:keywordprg| does not exist by default.
	|g:keywordprg| also does not exist by default,
	but if the global value of 'keywordprg' is "man" or "man -s",
	the default value of |g:keywordprg| is:
	"{ man <count> <keyword> | col -b; }".




==============================================================================
BUGS						*altkwprg-bugs*

- |<Plug>(altkwprg-look)| does not emulate all behaviors of |:help| yet, for
  example, how to |:split| windows.

- There are many bugs around the world.




==============================================================================
CHANGELOG					*altkwprg-changelog*

0.0.0	2008-10-29T00:38:49+09:00
